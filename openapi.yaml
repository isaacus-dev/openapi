          description: 'The input documents enriched into version 1.0.0 of the Isaacus
            Legal Graph Schema (IGLS).


            All spans in an enriched document graph are indexed into the Unicode code
            point space of a source document. Access to source documents is thus required
            to resolve spans into text.


            The start and end indices of spans are zero-based (i.e., the first Unicode
            code point in the document is at index 0) and half-open (i.e., the end
            index is exclusive).


            All spans are globally laminar and well-nested similar to XML—it is impossible
            for any two spans to partially overlap; they can only be disjoint, adjacent,
            or wholly nested.


            Spans of the exact same type (e.g., segments) will never be duplicated.


            Spans cannot be empty and will never start or end at whitespace.


            When using programming languages other than Python (which uses zero-based,
            half-open, Unicode code point-spaced string indexing), indices may need
            to be translated accordingly (for example, JavaScript slices into UTF-16
            code units instead of Unicode code points).'

            paragraph. It can only contain `item`s and `figure`s.


            An `item` is a syntactically subordinate unit of text such as an item
            in a run-in list. It can only contain other `item`s. Note that an `item`
            is conceptually distinct from a list item—it is perfectly possible to
            encounter list items that are syntactically independent of their surrounding
            items just as it is possible to encounter dependent clauses that do not
            appear as part of a list.

          description: 'The addressable ''type'' of the segment within the document''s
            referential scheme and hierarchy, whether defined explicitly (e.g., by
            headings, such as ''Section 2. Definitions''), implicitly (e.g., by way
            of reference, such as ''as defined in Section 2''), or by convention (e.g.,
            [42] in a judgment often denotes a `paragraph`, independent provisions
            in statute are often `section`s, etc.). If the type is not known or not
            applicable, it will be set to `null`.


            Note that, although many segment types may coincide with syntactic constructs,
            they should be thought of purely as distinct formal citable units. Most
            paragraphs (in the syntactic sense) will not have the `paragraph` type,
            for example. That type is reserved for segments that would formally be
            cited as a ''Paragraph'' within the document''s referential scheme.


            The following types are currently supported: `title`, `book`, `part`,
            `chapter`, `subchapter`, `division`, `subdivision`, `subpart`, `subtitle`,
            `table_of_contents`, `article`, `section`, `regulation`, `rule`, `clause`,
            `paragraph`, `subarticle`, `subsection`, `subregulation`, `subrule`, `subclause`,
            `subparagraph`, `item`, `subitem`, `point`, `indent`, `schedule`, `annex`,
            `appendix`, `exhibit`, `recital`, `signature`, `note`, `figure`, `table`,
            and `formula`.


            The `title`, `book`, `part`, `chapter`, `subchapter`, `division`, `subdivision`,
            `subpart`, `subtitle`, and `table_of_contents` types are exclusive to
            the `container` kind.


            The `figure` kind only supports the `figure`, `table`, and `formula` types,
            all of which are exclusive to it.'

            `front_matter` denotes non-operative contextualizing content occurring
            at the start of a document such as a preamble or recitals.


            `scope` denotes operative content defining the application or interpretation
            of a document such as definition sections and governing law clauses.


            `main` denotes operative, non-scopal content.


            `annotation` denotes non-operative annotative content providing explanatory
            or referential information such as commentary, footnotes, and endnotes.


            `back_matter` denotes non-operative contextualizing content occurring
            at the end of a document such as authority statements.


            `other` denotes content that does not fit into any of the other categories.'

      description: 'A zero-based, half-open span into the Unicode code point space

        All spans are globally laminar and well-nested similar to XML—it is impossible
        for any two spans to partially overlap; they can only be disjoint, adjacent,
        or wholly nested. Spans of the exact same type (e.g., segments) will never
        be duplicated.


        A span cannot be empty and will never start or end at whitespace.


        Note that, when using programming languages other than Python (which uses
        zero-based, half-open, Unicode code point-spaced string indexing), indices
        may need to be translated accordingly (for example, JavaScript slices into
        UTF-16 code units instead of Unicode code points).'

        - The concept of negligence is central to tort law, with courts assessing
          whether a breach of duty caused harm.
